/**
 * Favorite Controller
 * 
 * This controller handles HTTP requests and responses for the favorites system.
 * It provides a thin layer between HTTP and business logic, extracting data
 * from requests, calling service methods, and formatting responses.
 * 
 * Architecture note: Controllers should be thin orchestration layers. They parse
 * requests, delegate to services, and format responses. Business logic lives in
 * the service layer, not here. This keeps controllers focused on HTTP concerns
 * like status codes, headers, and response formatting.
 * 
 * All controllers follow the same pattern:
 * 1. Extract and validate request data
 * 2. Get user context from authenticated request (req.user)
 * 3. Call appropriate service functions
 * 4. Format and return HTTP response
 * 5. Let error middleware handle any exceptions

 * Add an establishment to user's favorites

 * 
 * This endpoint allows authenticated users to bookmark establishments for later

 * times produces the same result without errors, which provides better UX for
 * scenarios like double-clicks or network retries.
 * 
 * Security note: The user_id comes from the authenticated context (JWT token),
 * never from the request body. This prevents users from adding favorites to
 * other users' collections by manipulating the request.
 * 
 * Request body requirements are enforced by validation middleware before this
 * controller executes. By the time we reach this code, we know establishment_id
 * is present and is a valid UUID format.
